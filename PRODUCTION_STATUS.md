# Production Server Status - RESOLVED âœ…

## Issue Summary
The form submission issue has been **completely resolved**. The problem was with backend database configuration, not the frontend.

## Root Cause
- **Database Host Misconfiguration**: Application was trying to connect to MySQL on `172.27.0.9:3306` instead of `localhost:3306`
- **Environment Variable Issue**: `.env.production` had incorrect `DB_HOST` setting
- **Build Cache Problem**: Required clean rebuild to pick up new environment settings

## Solution Applied
1. âœ… Fixed `DB_HOST` from `172.27.0.9` to `localhost` in `.env.production`
2. âœ… Rebuilt application with clean cache (`npm run build`)
3. âœ… Started server with explicit environment variables
4. âœ… Configured server to listen on all interfaces (`0.0.0.0:3000`)

## Current Production Status
- âœ… **Application**: Running on http://localhost:3000 (and network interfaces)
- âœ… **Database**: MySQL/MariaDB connected successfully
- âœ… **Registration API**: Working perfectly (`/api/registrations`)
- âœ… **Data Storage**: Successfully saving to database
- âœ… **Form Submissions**: Fully functional

## Test Results
```bash
# Successful API test
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/registrations \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"firstName":"Final","lastName":"Test","email":"final@example.com",...}'

# Response: {"success":true,"message":"Registration created successfully","data":{...}}
```

## How to Maintain Production Server

### Starting the Server
```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd /home/peter/Desktop/dev/ntlp

# Start production server with correct environment
DB_HOST=localhost DB_PORT=3306 DB_USER=conf_user DB_PASSWORD=toor DB_NAME=conf NODE_ENV=production npx next start -p 3000 -H 0.0.0.0
```

### For Persistent Running (Recommended)
```bash
# Install PM2 for process management
npm install -g pm2

# Create ecosystem file
cat > ecosystem.config.js << 'EOF'
module.exports = {
  apps: [{
    name: 'ntlp-conference',
    script: 'npx',
    args: 'next start -p 3000 -H 0.0.0.0',
    env: {
      NODE_ENV: 'production',
      DB_HOST: 'localhost',
      DB_PORT: '3306',
      DB_USER: 'conf_user',
      DB_PASSWORD: 'toor',
      DB_NAME: 'conf'
    }
  }]
}
EOF

# Start with PM2
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js
pm2 save
pm2 startup
```

### Checking Application Status
```bash
# Check if server is running
curl -I http://localhost:3000

# Check database connection
mysql -h localhost -u conf_user -ptoor conf -e "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM registrations;"

# Check recent registrations
mysql -h localhost -u conf_user -ptoor conf -e "SELECT id, firstName, lastName, email, createdAt FROM registrations ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 5;"
```

### Troubleshooting Commands
```bash
# Check running processes
ps aux | grep next

# Check port usage
netstat -tlnp | grep :3000

# Check logs (if using PM2)
pm2 logs ntlp-conference

# Debug database connection
node debug-production.js
```

## External Access (Optional)
To allow external access on http://172.27.0.9:3000:
```bash
# Check firewall
sudo ufw status

# Allow port 3000 if needed
sudo ufw allow 3000
```

## Files Cleaned Up
- Removed redundant documentation and migration files
- Consolidated database setup into single `database/setup.sql`
- Kept only essential files for production deployment
- Added production troubleshooting guide

## Next Steps
1. **Set up PM2** for persistent server management
2. **Configure firewall** if external access is needed
3. **Set up SSL/HTTPS** for production security
4. **Configure domain name** if required
5. **Set up automated backups** for the database

The conference registration system is now **fully operational** on the production server! ðŸš€
